Nice to see Dharma gracing the august occassion
Great Honour
Sanathani is pride and true cluture of India. We all must embrace and know more about our culture. Time has come to discover the forgotten and untold spirit of our culture. Who knew the importance of Sengol untill this momemt. Im sure will learn more and more under Modi regime. Its woundedful to watch all spiritual gurus at one place. Its so devine in their presence.
"JAI MAA BHARATI, JAI SANATAN..."
"Only HINDU  HINDU  BHAI  BHAI 
Every Hindu wherever he lives, whatever his language is.....should acknowledge

There should be a tradition now onwards where the president will hand over the sengol to every newly elected prime minister who eventually will give it to speaker who will place it above the speaker chair which will signify the sengol is the supreme authority of power and the person in chair is currently exercising it. It would be so rad if they do it.

"I support sengol
It our culture
Dmdk"
Our heritage has a lot to inspire us. But shame on thr opposition parties to make the event sour without making it public
"This is good  , but I would have happier if A priest ( by karma but born in extemely lower caste by birth ) would done the main pooja ।। This would have meant greater respect to all citizens"
Sengol paain O ehara puratana sanskruti paain garba anubhav heuchhi...
Too proud to see our ancient value system being upheld and decorated so globally by the present government. But it hurts to know no aircraft was provided to uplift 40 jawans.
Strange moment...when whole India is celebrating the Tamil culture but the tamil people are criticising
I love you my country jay hind bharat matha ke jay
We radical patriots just need these kinds of moments to feel glorified.
So Nice
"Our spiritual masters, Gurus, and Sanyasis are all shanta sorupees! Very quiet, calm, peaceful, speak little, no evil spoken about other religions, etc. Compare that to some other religious heads! Om Namashivaya!"

"The Final Countdown of Lutyens is both the Sengol and in the new Parliament building. JH. 
The last highest vestige of colonial era, the old Parliament building, to be left standing, a reminder cum museum to show case the 45 trillion craftily missing and not shown in History books anywhere, also the deprivations and deaths of millions of our Indians citizens."
I wish  a day will comes that day our sadhus will   feel  real ram raj

All is great bin mighty Modi ERA no flights for Indian  Army But flights for sadhus and priest of Modi ERA . Modhi sacrifice lives of innocent army for his ego and pride. Shame on him and his godhi media who would not say a word against this .
Feeling sad for azad ravan
JAI BHARAT 🇮🇳
Those seculars who could not find anything wrong in Christian chief minister of North East taking oath keeping Bible in hand and priest quoting scriptures in the very presence of Modi will find this as  Fascism
"How come a secular nation can allow all this? Why not sikh, Christians etc also be given the same privilege to present their sengol like artifacts to the PM. Why only a specific religion is chosen just to appease voters of a specific majority religion?"
Tamils proud
"How these priests could  be invited as official guest?
Has these  persons ever toiled to get those status or had got that privileges in  hereditary. It means they have exclusive reservation ."
Very good
Abba Father Holy Spirit Lord Jesus Christ Mother Mary send your 12 legions of Guardian Angels to protect our Country from the Evil one and bless us with a God fearing PM in the 2024 Elections in Jesus's Holy name we pray Amen thank you Jesus praise you Jesus Hallelujah Amen

"All the glory and power to our culture being promoted, it's the pride of the nation afterall.

But my man here really needs to work on his diet, not good for his health. No part of our culture says we should accept being unhealthy"
This is how India to be treated
North Indians are ruled by Muslims and they don’t have anything that represent Hinduism and Hindu culture….Glad we tamilians and  our great kings making Modi and parliament proud… good that modi is finally understanding the richness of Tamil language and its culture…
Holy Spirit reveal the whole truth about BJP VHP RSS Bajrang dal leaders agenda and the Media to the entire world Amen
"This is not culture this is religious in evey aspect. Rather than having scientists,innovators and real contributors of thie country ,this PM has the audactoy to use our money and make it a religious ceremony.  ANI ,it is a parliament ,and equal to every one. Why the hell tax payers money is used for this nuisance. Shame"

"With Modiji the nation is reviving the great Chola culture which is nothing but today's Tamilnadu culture. Sadly, Tamilnadu is getting converted in the hands of missioneries. Now it's responsibilty of every Tamil person to save Hindu culture there. Also, it's responsibility of Tamil Brahmin pujaris to leave their greed and give respect to lower  casts. I have seen how they just try to squeeze money from the needy if they approach these Brahmin pujaris to perform spiritual rites. 

Let me tell the incident I have seen:
During Covid 2nd wave one Odia woman died in Pondicherry. Her funeral was done as per Covid protocol. The family could not travel back to native place and hence called Tamil Brahmin to perform final rites. They demanded 1 lakh plus bhojan (money for the same) and daana to 40 Brahmins. This daana was supposed to include gold, silver, copper, brass, bronze, food grains and pulses, oil, ghee, vastra,(clothes), puja samagri, mattress, footwear, walking stick, spiritual books and what not. The family negotiated and fixed it for 35 thousand. On 12th day, the Brahmins performed Shanti Havana but no pinddaan was done. 
जितना दाम उतना ही कामNo wonder, majority of Tamilnadu follows Periyar which in turn is being usurped by missionaries for conversion."

ENERGY & MONEY.!"""

"केरला की सच्ची स्टोरी 
वीरांगना नगेली कौन?? 

हम प्रत्येक शनिवार को महिला दिवस के रूप में मनाएंगे और क्रांतिकारी महिलाएं जैसे कि वीरांगना फूलन देवी और वीरांगना नगेली, वीरांगना झलकारी बाई कोरी को नमन करेंगें और उनके जीवन संघर्षों को जन जन तक पहुंचाने की कोशिश करेंगे। 

️जब हिन्दू धर्म में महिलाओं को स्तन ढकने का भी  अधिकार नहीं था इसलिए स्तन ही काट दिया ️

नंगेली का नाम केरल के बाहर शायद किसी ने न सुना हो. किसी स्कूल के इतिहास की किताब में उनका ज़िक्र या कोई तस्वीर भी नहीं मिलेगी.

लेकिन उनके साहस की मिसाल ऐसी है कि एक बार जानने पर कभी नहीं भूलेंगे, क्योंकि नंगेली ने स्तन ढकने के अधिकार के लिए अपने ही स्तन काट दिए थे.

केरल के इतिहास के पन्नों में छिपी ये लगभग सौ से डेढ़ सौ साल पुरानी कहानी उस समय की है जब केरल के बड़े भाग में त्रावणकोर के राजा का शासन था.

जातिवाद की जड़ें बहुत गहरी थीं और निचली जातियों की महिलाओं को उनके स्तन न ढकने का आदेश था. उल्लंघन करने पर उन्हें 'ब्रेस्ट टैक्स' यानी 'स्तन कर' देना पड़ता था.

डॉ.शीबा
केरल के श्री शंकराचार्य संस्कृत विश्वविद्यालय में जेंडर इकॉलॉजी और दलित स्टडीज़ की एसोसिएट प्रोफ़ेसर डॉ. शीबा केएम बताती हैं कि ये वो समय था जब पहनावे के कायदे ऐसे थे कि एक व्यक्ति को देखते ही उसकी जाति की पहचान की जा सकती थी.

डॉ. शीबा कहती हैं, ""ब्रेस्ट टैक्स का मक़सद जातिवाद के ढांचे को बनाए रखना था. ये एक तरह से एक औरत के निचली जाति से होने की कीमत थी. इस कर को बार-बार अदा कर पाना इन ग़रीब समुदायों के लिए मुमकिन नहीं था.""

केरल के हिंदुओं में जाति के ढांचे में नायर जाति को शूद्र माना जाता था जिनसे निचले स्तर पर एड़वा और फिर दलित समुदायों को रखा जाता था.

दलित समुदाय
उस दौर में दलित समुदाय के लोग ज़्यादातर खेतिहर मज़दूर थे और ये कर देना उनके बस के बाहर था. ऐसे में एड़वा और नायर समुदाय की औरतें ही इस कर को देने की थोड़ी क्षमता रखती थीं.

डॉ. शीबा के मुताबिक इसके पीछे सोच थी कि अपने से ऊंची जाति के आदमी के सामने औरतों को अपने स्तन नहीं ढकने चाहिए.

वो बताती हैं, ""ऊंची जाति की औरतों को भी मंदिर में अपने सीने का कपड़ा हटा देना होता था, पर निचली जाति की औरतों के सामने सभी मर्द ऊंची जाति के ही थे. तो उनके पास स्तन ना ढकने के अलावा कोई विकल्प नहीं था.""

इसी बीच एड़वा जाति की एक महिला, नंगेली ने इस कर को दिए बग़ैर अपने स्तन ढकने का फ़ैसला कर लिया.

केरल के चेरथला में अब भी इलाके के बुज़ुर्ग उस जगह का पता बता देते हैं जहां नंगेली रहती थीं.

मोहनन नारायण 
ऑटो चलाने वाले मोहनन नारायण हमें वो जगह दिखाने साथ चल पड़े. उन्होंने बताया, ""कर मांगने आए अधिकारी ने जब नंगेली की बात को नहीं माना तो नंगेली ने अपने स्तन ख़ुद काटकर उसके सामने रख दिए.""

लेकिन इस साहस के बाद ख़ून ज़्यादा बहने से नंगेली की मौत हो गई. बताया जाता है कि नंगेली के दाह संस्कार के दौरान उनके पति ने भी अग्नि में कूदकर अपनी जान दे दी.

नंगेली का जन्म स्थान
नंगेली की याद में उस जगह का नाम मुलच्छीपुरम यानी 'स्तन का स्थान' रख दिया गया. पर समय के साथ अब वहां से नंगेली का परिवार चला गया है और साथ ही इलाके का नाम भी बदलकर मनोरमा जंक्शन पड़ गया है.

बहुत कोशिश के बाद वहां से कुछ किलोमीटर की दूरी पर रह रहे नंगेली के पड़पोते मणियन वेलू का पता मिला.

मणियन
साइकिल किनारे लगाकर मणियन ने बताया कि नंगेली के परिवार की संतान होने पर उन्हें बहुत गर्व है.

उनका कहना था, ""उन्होंने अपने लिए नहीं बल्कि सारी औरतों के लिए ये कदम उठाया था जिसका नतीजा ये हुआ कि राजा को ये कर वापस लेना पड़ा.""

लेकिन इतिहासकार डॉ. शीबा ये भी कहती हैं कि इतिहास की किताबों में नंगेली के बारे में इतनी कम पड़ताल की गई है कि उनके विरोध और कर वापसी में सीधा रिश्ता कायम करना बहुत मुश्किल है.
वो कहती हैं, ""इतिहास हमेशा पुरुषों की नज़र से लिखा गया है, पिछले दशकों में कुछ कोशिशें शुरू हुई हैं महिलाओं के बारे में जानकारी जुटाने की, शायद उनमें कभी नंगेली की बारी भी आ जाए और हमें उनके साहसी कदम के बारे में विस्तार से और कुछ पता चल पाए."""
